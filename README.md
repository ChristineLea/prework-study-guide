# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This study guide was created for boot camp students who are working through the Prework.
I was motivated to build this project to provide core basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript in an easy to read layout.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide can be used to read notes on each area of study covered in the boot camp prework. To see JavaScript in action open the Chrome DevTools. This can be accessed by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). Navigate to the console tab and you can view a list of the topics learnt, and generate suggestions on what to study first. Refresh the webpage and take note of how the output changes in the console panel.
